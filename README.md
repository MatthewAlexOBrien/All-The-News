# All-The-News
Project to examine racial and gender biases from news articles in the 'All The News' dataset. 


Phase 1 - Text cleaning to prepare articles for further anlyisis. If you are interested in the methods used to parse and clean text, please see Static_Functions.py

Phase 2 - Identify articles that are written strinctly about people who have passed away. Ultimatly, we want to only look at articles that refer to a single individual,
since it would be otherwise impossible to attibute article sentiments to one person or another. Code for this portion will be uploaded shortly.

Phase 3 - Given our small subset of articles, examine average article sentiment across racial and gender lines. Code for this phase will but uploded after phase 2 is completed/
